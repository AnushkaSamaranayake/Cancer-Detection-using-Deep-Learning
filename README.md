## Introduction

Brain tumors can be life-threatening if not diagnosed early. This project utilizes a deep learning approach using a CNN model to detect brain tumors from MRI images. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images, classifying them as either having a tumor or not.

## Dataset

The model is trained using a dataset of brain MRI images. Each image is labeled as having a tumor or not. The dataset should be organized in the following structure:
